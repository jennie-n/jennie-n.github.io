								<h1>Summary</h1>
								<p>At BART, I worked as a systems engineering intern with the Fare Collection Engineering (FCE) team, the Maintenance & Engineering (M&E) division that is responsible
									for systems related to fare collection and ticketing. I also worked with engineers in Computer Systems Engineering (CSE), the division responsible for production
									computer systems.Â FCE and CSE are both part of the Systems Engineering department of M&E. I was very excited and am still really grateful for the opportunity to
									work on a project that has real-world applications, could help so many people, and was similar to my <a href="bus.html">capstone project</a> which also involved
									sensors for public transportation purposes. I also felt the role and project really fit me as a computer engineering student with a focus on computer systems
									because I was able to utilize my education and knowledge in both software and hardware, as well as work with unfamiliar things and learn from them.</p>
									Below is additional information on my project from an article on BART's website.

								<h1>Sensor Project</h1>
								<p>My project for the summer was to research and test sensors that could be used in the next version of the fare gates. The new fare gates aim to reduce fare evasion,
									help modernize the stations, and be more user friendly to the patrons that use them. The new sensors would be used to make progress on meeting all of these goals
									by better detecting people and their belongings in the aisle while bringing in new technology. Read more about
									<a href="https://www.bart.gov/about/projects/fare-gate" target="_blank">recent fare gate modifications</a> and
									<a href="https://www.bart.gov/about/projects/fare-evasion" target="_blank">fare evasion plans</a> on BART's website.</p>
								<p>My team worked on many aspects of project planning, including research, procurement, testing, and documenting. The research I conducted involved reading documentation
									about BART's current fare gates and their sensors, reviewing last year's intern's report and code, and analyzing new sensors that meet the requirements and could
									be used. I compiled the research into a summary and pro/con list of each sensor, a matrix of sensor requirements and specifications, and a Bill of
									Materials for the sensors that were chosen. Being able to participate in meetings with project managers, stakeholders, and consultants helped me to revise these files.</p>
								<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
								<p>After researching, attending meetings with stakeholders, and understanding the (customer and engineering) requirements better, my team chose <b>ultrasonic, infrared, and
									thermal sensors</b> to purchase and test. <b>LIDAR and pressure mat sensors</b> were researched and considered as well. I also worked with the <b>Raspberry Pi 3B+</b> and
									wrote the sensor code in <b>python</b>. <b>I2C and UART</b> were the serial communication protocols used to transmit data from the sensors to the pi.
								</p>
								<h2>Moving Forward</h2>
								<p>The FCE team at BART will be able to use the code and research from this summer to give them a better idea of what sensors they would like to utilize as they continue
									improving and working on the safest, quickest, and most modern version of the fare gates yet. I'm excited to see the new technology at BART stations in the next few years!</p>
